Dear Hometown Drug Company Team,

Workshop Iso is excited to propose a risk-free social media management service to elevate Hometown Drug Company’s online presence at 307 N Broadway St, Poteau, OK. Our Marketing & Influence team, using AdOptimizer v0.5.0, will create engaging content to connect with Poteau’s community, drive foot traffic, and highlight your pharmacy’s personalized care. This revised proposal includes contingencies to ensure your satisfaction.

## Why Social Media?
- **Community Connection**: With ~8,800 residents, Poteau thrives on local trust. Social media engages 70% of small-town consumers via platforms like Facebook.
- **Revenue Boost**: Targeted posts can increase store visits by 10-20%, adding $500-$1,000/week in sales.
- **Competitive Edge**: Stand out against Walmart Pharmacy with authentic, community-focused content.
