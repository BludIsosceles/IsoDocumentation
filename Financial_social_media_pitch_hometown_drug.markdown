**Subject**: Social Media Management Proposal for Hometown Drug Company

Dear Hometown Drug Company Team,

At Workshop Iso, we specialize in creative and strategic marketing solutions to boost local businesses like yours. We’re excited to propose a social media management service to enhance Hometown Drug Company’s online presence, engage the Poteau community, and drive more customers to your pharmacy at 307 N Broadway St. Our tailored approach, powered by our AdOptimizer v0.5.0 tool, will showcase your personalized care, prescription services, and community commitment.

## Why Social Media?
- **Community Engagement**: Poteau’s tight-knit community (pop. ~8,800) relies on local businesses. Social media builds trust and loyalty, with 70% of small-town consumers checking Facebook for local updates.[](https://www.yellowpages.com/poteau-ok/hometown-drug)
- **Increased Foot Traffic**: Targeted posts can promote your services (e.g., immunizations, medication synchronization) to drive in-store visits.[](https://www.rxless.com/pharmacies/oklahoma/poteau/hometown-drug-company-llc/307-N-Broadway-St/1962791483)
- **Brand Visibility**: Regular, high-quality content will position Hometown Drug as the go-to pharmacy, outshining competitors like Walmart Pharmacy.[](https://www.yellowpages.com/poteau-ok/hometown-pharmacy-hours-of-operation)

## Our Proposal
We offer a comprehensive social media management package for $75/week, including 5 weekly posts across Facebook and Instagram, tailored to Poteau’s audience.

### Services
- **Content Creation**:
  - **Health Tips**: Weekly posts on medication adherence, vaccinations, or over-the-counter products (e.g., “Beat allergies with our antihistamines!”).[](https://ak.rxspark.com/pharmacy-listings/hometown-drug-company-llc-307-n-broadway-poteau-ok-74953-3355)
  - **Promotions**: Highlight discounts via RxSpark (up to 90% off prescriptions) or in-store specials.[](https://www.rxspark.com/pharmacy-listings/hometown-drug-company-llc-307-n-broadway-st-poteau-ok-74953-3355)
  - **Community Spotlight**: Share customer stories, staff profiles (e.g., immunizing technicians), or event sponsorships (e.g., Poteau Chamber events).[](https://poteauchamber.wordpress.com/)
  - **Visuals**: Eye-catching graphics with pastel colors and retro Poteau vibes, reflecting local history (e.g., Bonnie and Clyde’s bank robbery).[](https://www.travelok.com/listings/view.profile/id.13411)

  - Saturday: Fun fact or local history (e.g., “Did you know Poteau’s courthouse hosted outlaws?”).
  - Sunday: Customer engagement (e.g., poll: “What’s your go-to OTC med?”).
