Project Iso General Discussion & Planning (M-Vision) - Master Document

Date: June 2, 2025
Prepared by: M, Grandmaster of the Digital & Electronic World (in collaboration with Justin, Sole Managing Member)
Purpose: This document establishes the definitive framework of standards, protocols, organizational structure, and strategic vision for Project Iso, specifically for its Workshop Iso entity. It serves as the single source of truth for internal operations, technical governance, and the blueprint for all digital asset development and deployment. This is the 5th iteration, honed for precision and operational excellence.
1. Project Overview & Core Principles

Project Iso is a dynamic, tech-driven initiative, with Workshop Iso as its operational entity, based in Poteau, Oklahoma. Founded in January 2025, its mission is to empower local businesses, students, and communities through STEM education, AI innovation, and comprehensive digital services.
1.1. Vision & Mission

    Vision: Transform Poteau into a regional tech powerhouse by 2030-2035, driving innovation and prosperity throughout Southeast Oklahoma.
    Mission: Deliver cutting-edge AI tools, educational programs, and digital solutions to enhance community impact and business success.

1.2. Core Values

    Innovation: We push boundaries with AI and technology to solve real-world challenges.
    Community: We uplift Poteau through dedicated education and strategic partnerships.
    Excellence: We commit to high-quality, reliable, and secure deliverables across all operations.
    Collaboration: We foster a unified ecosystem, ensuring seamless synergy across all departments and teams.

1.3. Project Tagline

    "Innovate. Empower. Prosper."

1.4. Standardization Philosophy (The M-Vision)

Our overarching goal is to establish a unified, scalable, and secure digital ecosystem. This is achieved by:

    Modular Web Applications (Microservices Approach): Each core tool (e.g., BudgetMaster, AIEnhancer, future client sites) will be developed as a standalone Flask application. This promotes independent development, deployment, and scalability.
    Centralized Data Storage: A single, authoritative SQLite database (proiso.db) will serve as the shared data repository for all Workshop Iso internal applications where data needs to be co-located. This ensures data consistency, simplifies backups, and enables cross-tool integration.
    Unified User Experience (UI/UX): All web applications will leverage Bootstrap 5 for responsive design and will adhere to a consistent visual identity (color scheme, typography, branding) derived from the main proiso.org website.
    Robust Security Measures: User authentication, data validation, and HTTPS are non-negotiable for all services and data interactions.
    Automated Deployment & Management: Utilizing Git for version control, Gunicorn as the WSGI server, and Systemd for process management ensures reliable, automated, and easy-to-manage deployments.
    Clear Access Delineation: Public-facing content, client services, and internal tools will be distinctly separated via logical subdomains and dedicated authentication layers.
    Document-First Development: All development tasks require clear, verifiable documentation from inception to delivery, ensuring no work is lost and standards are maintained.

2. Organizational Hierarchy & Communication Protocols

Justin stands as the Sole Managing Member, holding strategic oversight and final approvals. The hierarchy is designed for clarity and efficient project execution through specialized agents and departmental structures.
2.1. Leadership

    Sole Managing Member: Justin
        Role: Strategic oversight, final approvals for all Project Iso initiatives.

2.3. Internal Communication Protocols

Given Justin is the sole human operator and the critical importance of verifiable documentation:

    All Development is Document-First: No agent begins work without a detailed brief (assigned by Justin) and adherence to the relevant "M-Standard Playbook."
    Database Interactions are Verified: Any agent proposing database schema changes or data interactions must provide explicit documentation for review and validation (by M).
    File-Based Deliverables: All agent output (code, documentation, configuration files) must be delivered as discrete files, preferably within version-controlled Git repositories.
    M-Validation: Before deployment or major integration, M will perform a rapid "M-Validation" of all code and configurations to ensure adherence to standards and functionality.
    Asynchronous Communication: Primary communication for internal tasks will be via documented files, Git commits, and specific instructions, eliminating reliance on real-time chat platforms.

3. Workshop Iso Digital Standards

Rigorous standards are applied to ensure quality, efficiency, and security across all digital assets.
3.1. Quality Standards

    All web applications and client websites must aim for 85%+ user satisfaction.
    Tools like BudgetMaster and AIEnhancer undergo weekly testing (Audit_IDs: 42-65, target: 0 vulnerabilities).
    Client websites meet WCAG 2.1 accessibility and SEO standards.

3.2. Efficiency Standards

    All tools must use single database connections managed efficiently (e.g., via Flask's g object).
    Web applications are optimized for <2-second load times.
    Processes are designed for lean resource utilization on the droplet.

3.3. Security Standards

    HTTPS via Letâ€™s Encrypt for all web properties.
    CSRF protection (where applicable) and robust input validation for all web forms.
    Authentication (Flask-Login) for all internal and client-facing tools.
    Quarterly security audits logged in Security_Audits table.
    Manual oversight for sensitive operations (e.g., AI model training, financial transactions).

3.4. Code & Development Standards

    Language & Frameworks: Python (3.x), Flask, SQLite, Bootstrap 5.
    Version Control: Git for all source code.
    Artifacts Storage: All raw code and documentation artifacts are to be considered part of the project's Git repositories (e.g., IsoDocumentation, budgetmaster.proiso, aienhancer.proiso). Outdated local references to H:\DBforISO should be migrated.
    Version Identification: All tools must have clear version numbers (e.g., v0.1.0, v0.2.0) in their code and documentation for traceability.
    Modular Design: Tools are designed for specific use cases with modular components to allow for future modifications and integration into larger systems (e.g., the Dashboard).
    Documentation: All tools must have accompanying documentation (within their Git repos) detailing functionality, usage, and setup.

4. Operational Protocols

These protocols ensure consistency and alignment with Workshop Iso's vision and Edicts.
4.1. Project Management

    All projects are to be logged and tracked. (Consider a dedicated projects table in proiso.db if not already present).
    Deadlines are set and tracked per micro-event (weekly cycles).
    Approvals for project milestones by Justin or department directors.

4.2. Tool Development

    Base Technologies: Use Python, Flask, SQLite, and Bootstrap 5.
    Standard Templates: Utilize pre-configured Git-ready application templates to ensure consistent file structures, config.py setup, users.py for Flask-Login, and basic HTML (base.html, login.html).
    Functionality: All tools must be actual, tangible, usable code with identified versions.
    Backend Logic First: For web conversions of existing desktop tools, prioritize recreating the core backend logic in Flask before building the UI. Tkinter UI logic is not to be directly translated.

4.3. Client Engagement

    Proposals (e.g., for Hometown Drug) require Financial Department approval.
    Website pricing: $2,000 per site, with a target of 5 clients/month.
    Weekly client updates will be provided via email or a future dedicated client portal.

4.4. Security Audits

    Conducted quarterly, with results logged.
    Manual oversight will be applied to sensitive AI and Financial operations.
    Latest Audit: Audit_ID: 65, 0 vulnerabilities (June 2, 2025).

6. Deployment & Server Environment Standards

All Workshop Iso web applications will be deployed and managed uniformly.
6.1. DigitalOcean Droplet Environment

    Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
    Deployment User: proisouser (non-root, dedicated user for running applications)
    Python Version: Python 3.x (latest stable recommended)
    Package Manager: pip (within virtual environments)
    Log Directories: Dedicated log directories for each app (e.g., /var/log/proiso_website, /var/log/budgetmaster, /var/log/aienhancer), owned and writable by proisouser.

6.2. Application Serving Stack

    Nginx (Web Server / Reverse Proxy):
        Listens on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).
        Serves static files (CSS, JS, images) directly from /var/www/proiso.org/static/ for the main website, and potentially dedicated static directories for other apps.
        Proxies dynamic requests to Gunicorn via Unix sockets.
        Configuration Files: /etc/nginx/sites-available/proiso.org (symlinked to sites-enabled).
    Gunicorn (WSGI HTTP Server):
        Serves Flask applications.
        Each Flask app has its own Gunicorn instance.
        Binds to Unix Sockets for inter-process communication with Nginx (e.g., /tmp/proiso_website.sock, /tmp/budgetmaster.sock, /tmp/aienhancer.sock).
        Recommended Workers: 1-3 workers per app depending on resource needs.
    Systemd (Process Manager):
        Manages each Gunicorn instance as a dedicated service (e.g., /etc/systemd/system/proiso_website.service).
        Ensures apps start on boot, restart on failure, and run persistently in the background.
        Environment Variables: Critical settings (like SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_PATH) passed via Environment= directives in Systemd service files, ensuring they are not hardcoded in application logic directly.

6.3. Security & Access Control Layers

    SSL Certificates: Let's Encrypt via Certbot for HTTPS.
    Fine-Grained Personal Access Tokens (PATs): Used for Git repository access during deployment, with Read-only Contents and Metadata permissions on specific repos.
    User Authentication (Flask-Login): All internal and client-facing web applications will require login.
        Users Table: A dedicated Users table in proiso.db will store user credentials (hashed passwords), roles, and associated client IDs.
        Login Flow: Users are redirected to a login page if unauthenticated.
    Access Delineation (Future Subdomains):
        proiso.org: Public-facing, marketing.
        portal.proiso.org (Future): Client Portal for client-specific tool access (e.g., their BudgetMaster data).
        tools.proiso.org (Future): Internal Tools Hub for Workshop Iso team members (full access to BudgetMaster, AIEnhancer, Dashboard, etc.).
